# Action Search

Search the menus and perform the action.

## Implementation

- Each time the command gets called, find all active menu entries.

## Todo

- Move the "Actions search" to the Help menu
- If multiple words are typed, split the string and show the entries that contain all words.
- Find a way to add actions that are inside of dialogs (Properties palettes: display and activate?)
- retab

## Notes

- Inspired by the [Olive Video Editor](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive) `/` command.

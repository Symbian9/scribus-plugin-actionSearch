# Action Search

Search the menus and perform the action.

## Implementation

- Each time the command gets called, find all active menu entries

## Todo

- add a translatable place holder in the qlineedit
- clear and add the filtered list
- place the dialog in the middle of the screen
- can i add a default shortcut from the plugin?

## Notes

- Inspired by the [Olive Video Editor](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive) `/` command.
